# =============================================================================
# Delta triage configuration
#
# Controls which results are logged and which are escalated to full CRT.
# =============================================================================

# Stage 1: GPU/partial CRT screening
# Only log trajectory-level results when delta exceeds this threshold.
# delta > 0 means convergence is better than random.
screening:
  delta_threshold: 0.0
  K_small: 6              # Primes for partial CRT
  log_all_metadata: false  # If true, log metadata even for delta <= 0

# Stage 2: CPU full CRT escalation
# When delta > escalate_threshold, reconstruct full integer and verify
# at high precision against all target constants.
escalation:
  delta_threshold: 0.0     # Escalate when partial CRT delta > this
  targets:
    - "zeta3"
    - "zeta5"
    - "zeta7"
  mpmath_dps: 100          # Decimal places for verification
  save_full_integers: true # Save p, q as strings in positives log

# Stage 3: Positive classification
# A result is classified as "positive" if the full CRT verification
# confirms delta > positive_threshold.
positive:
  delta_threshold: 0.5     # High bar for confirmed positives
  alert: true              # Print alert to stdout
  separate_file: true      # Write to positives_rank{rank}.jsonl

# Performance limits
limits:
  max_escalations_per_rank: 10000  # Safety cap per rank
  max_positives_per_rank: 1000
